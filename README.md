# Advent of Code 2020
Solutions for Advent of Code 2020. Now with more completion! I'll be solving these challenges in Python.

# Structure
* Each solution file will be named for the day it solves, e.g. `day01.py`.
* Input data goes in the `input` folder, also named for the day provided, e.g. `input/day01`.

# Execution
Each of the script files is executable by default, so can be run directly as `./day01.py`.

For exploring the values of the variables, run the file interactively with Python like `python3 -i day01.py`.
